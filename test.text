In my test code, I attempted to utilize mixes of all operational tasks to stack the fitting qualities into the input registers. The objective was to ensure that by utilizing the entirety of the directions with the right qualities, I could control the qualities to wind up letting out a similar outcome as the example test code did and in the correct format. I expected to ensure my code would work, so I included the instructions into the code to test the remainder of them.
